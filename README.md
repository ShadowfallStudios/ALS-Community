## About This Repository

Advanced Locomotion system is built upon pretty outdated animation programming techniques of pre Unreal Engine 5 era, and I highly recommended to utilize other available locomotion systems, such as Epic's Lyra sample project. This repository will only receive engine compatibility fixes from now.

## Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Linux

*Console, Mac and mobile platforms are not tested and supported at the moment. Use the plugin on those platforms with your own risk.*

## Features
- Fully implemented and optimized in C++. Implementation is based on latest marketplace release (V4) of ALS
- Complete replication support with low bandwidth usage (Ragdoll replication is in experimental state)
- Redesigned as plugin
- Animation blueprint is optimized with new property binding feature
- Player input is handled with new Enhanced Input Plugin
- Mantling and debugging features are implemented as separate actor components to reduce total overhead on base character class
